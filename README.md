## 📖 Project Description  
A scalable, lightweight SQL database that stores structured information about top-grossing and influential films.  
The current dataset includes popular titles from **2024**, covering details such as directors, runtime, ratings, release years, genres, scores, gross revenue, and distributors.  

Designed for research efficiency, it serves as a querying and analytical tool for exploring filmmaking trends and industry performance across time.  

## 🎯 Purpose of the Database  
The system enables researchers, analysts, and media professionals to examine relationships between variables such as:  
- Revenue performance by genre or studio  
- Audience scores and rating correlations  
- Director and studio success trends  
- Release year patterns and historical film evolution  

This allows for insights into filmmaking trends, profitability, and audience reception across different eras and genres.

- **Excel**  
- **MySQL Workbench**  
- **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) modeling tools**  

## ⚙️ How to Run the SQL Scripts  
1. Open **MySQL Workbench** (or a compatible SQL client).  
2. Create a schema named `movies_db`.  
3. Run the provided SQL scripts in this order:
